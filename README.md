Solution :- 
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML consists of various elements and attributes that allow you to structure and display content on the web. Here are some key features and components of HTML:

1. Elements: HTML documents are composed of elements, which are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets. Elements can be used to structure content, create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and more.

2. Text Content: HTML allows you to display text content, including headings (h1 to h6), paragraphs (p), and various inline elements like strong (for bold text), em (for italic text), and more.

3. Hyperlinks: You can create hyperlinks to link to other web pages or resources using the anchor element (a) and the href attribute.

4. Images and Multimedia: HTML supports the inclusion of images and multimedia content using elements like img, audio, and video.

5. Lists: HTML provides ordered lists (ol), unordered lists (ul), and definition lists (dl) for organising content in a list format.

6. Forms: HTML allows you to create interactive forms with input elements (text, password, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.), textarea, select, and submit buttons, enabling user input and data submission.

7. Tables: Tables can be created using the table element, including rows (tr), table headers (th), and table data cells (td).

8. Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like header, nav, article, section, aside, and footer to provide better structure and meaning to web content, improving accessibility and SEO.

9. Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or modify their behaviour. For example, the src attribute for images, alt for alternative text, and href for hyperlinks.

10. Document Structure: HTML documents typically include a doctype declaration, head section (with metadata like title and links to stylesheets), and body section (where the visible content is placed).

Task - 3
Solution :- 
Key aspects of web accessibility include:

1. Perceivability: Ensuring that information and user interface components are presented in a way that can be perceived by all users. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content like images, audio, and video, using clear and easily distinguishable text and background colours, and ensuring that content can be presented in multiple formats (e.g., text transcripts for audio content).

2. Operability: Making it possible for all users to interact with the website or application, regardless of the input method or assistive technology they use. This involves ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible, that users can navigate and perform actions without time limits, and that there are no design elements that may cause seizures or physical discomfort.

3. Understandability: Creating content that is easy to understand and navigate. This includes providing clear and consistent navigation, using simple and intuitive page layouts, and offering informative and descriptive page titles and headings.

4. Robustness: Building web content that is compatible with a variety of user agents (browsers and assistive technologies). This ensures that content will work correctly now and in the future as technology evolves. Adherence to web standards and the use of semantic HTML plays a significant role in achieving robustness.

Task - 4
Solution :- 
Use Semantic HTML Elements: Using semantic HTML elements helps improve accessibility by providing meaningful structure to your content. Semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, and <footer> convey the purpose of different sections to assistive technologies, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and understand the content.

Provide Alt Text for Images: Adding descriptive alt text to images using the alt attribute ensures that users who cannot see the images can understand their content and purpose. Screen readers read aloud the alt text, making visual content accessible to people with visual impairments. Aim to make alt text concise, informative, and relevant to the image.

Use Color with Care: Color plays an important role in web design, but it should not be the only means of conveying information. Ensure that color is not the sole indicator of meaning. For example, when using error messages, pair color with text that explains the error. Additionally, maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background to enhance readability for users with low vision.
